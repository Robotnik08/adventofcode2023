# Advent of code 2023, done with DOSATO

## Introduction

DOSATO is a programming language I build myself, and I'm using it to solve the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. <br>
The language is still in development, so I'm using this as a way to test it and improve it. <br>
It's also quite slow, so I'm using this as a way to test and improve the performance of the interpreter.<br>
You can check out the language [here](https://github.com/Robotnik08/Dosato).

## Day 1

Day 1 was quite easy, I did need to fix a bug with the REPLACE function. <br>

## Day 2

Coming soon...
