# Advent of code 2023, done with DOSATO

## Introduction

DOSATO is a programming language I build myself, and I'm using it to solve the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges. <br>
The language is still in development, so I'm using this as a way to test it and improve it. <br>
It's also quite slow, so I'm using this as a way to test and improve the performance of the interpreter.<br>
You can check out the language [here](https://github.com/Robotnik08/Dosato).

## Day 1

Day 1 was quite easy, I did need to fix a bug with the REPLACE function. <br>

## Day 2

Day 2 was a bit easier than day 1, I did need to add a few functions to the language, but nothing too complicated. <br>

## Day 3

Day 3 was a step up in difficulty, My language was ready for it though, no bugs found. <br>

## Day 4

My initial solution was bad and slow, but I managed to make it quick. Part 2 seemed menacing, but was really easy

## Day 5

Day 5 was a good challenge, I figured it out in the end, but it took me a while. <br>

## Day 6

Day 6 was easier, originally I brute forced it, but I managed to make it faster by using a quadratic formula. <br>
I researched about it and it's fun how it's used really well in the puzzle. <br>
I added a QUADRATIC function in the language for this purpose. <br>
